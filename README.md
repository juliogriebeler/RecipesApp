Recipes App

Objective
Write a single-page web application which allows users to explore your favourite recipes. Use a master-detail (master-view) interface to show a list of all available recipes (master) and a details pane where the following attributes are shown for the selected recipe:
•	Date of creation,
•	An image of the prepared dish,
•	Indicator if the dish is vegetarian,
•	Indicator displaying the number of people the dish is suitable for,
•	Unstructured list of ingredients, and
•	Cooking instructions.

Requirements
1.	The list of recipes can be retrieved through a RESTful web-service. The service should be implemented in Java.
2.	You should implement the client in JavaScript or a derivative of JavaScript, such as TypeScript. You may use any framework or libraries.
3.	Appropriate architectural and technical design patterns should be applied. E.g. when using OOP, use SOLID design.
4.	Write unit tests where applicable.
5.	Explain and defend, in 200-300 words, your choice of architecture and libraries.

Bonus
1.	The client is responsive and mobile friendly.
2.	The recipes are filterable and searchable.

Evaluation Criteria
Your assignment will be evaluated using the following criteria:
1.	The extent to which your work meets the requirements stated above.
2.	Ease of using and starting the application.
3.	The level of maturity exhibited in your rationale for the architecture and libraries.

Extra Information
1.	The implementation details are completely up to you. E.g. If you want to use a relational or NoSQL database, AngularJS or React, etc. Though, remember that every framework, library and architectural decision needs to be explained and defended.
